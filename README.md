PROBLEM STATEMENT 
 
According to the American Bankers Association survey, Banks with a Home equity line of credit  and Home equity loans average a 1 percent return on assets (ROA) overall, but earn 1.5 percent on their HELOCs and 1.25 percent on their HELs, which means that these two products are more profitable for banks than their average loans. But the delinquency rate on Home equity loans is higher than all other types of consumer loans. It is imperative for banks to take calculated risks in this area for financial growth.
 
A Bank offers a home equity line of credit to its clients. As per the dataset, many of these accepted applicants (approximately 20%) have defaulted on their loans. By using geographic, demographic, and financial variables, the bank wants to build a model to predict whether an applicant will default.


DATA COLLECTION

The data set HMEQ reports characteristics and delinquency information for 5,960 home equity loans. A home equity loan is a loan where the obligor uses the equity of his or her home as the underlying collateral. 
 
The data was obtained from the website http://www.creditriskanalytics.net in csv format.
